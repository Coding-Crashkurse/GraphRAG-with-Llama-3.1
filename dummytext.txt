Each family member contributed their unique flair, crafting a narrative of flavors that reflected their diverse experiences and deep-seated love for food.

Giovanni Caruso and Maria: The Founding Generation

Giovanni Caruso, Amico's great-grandfather, was a man of the earth. His calloused hands spoke of years spent cultivating the fertile soils of Santa Caterina, producing olives and grapes that were the pride of the region. Giovanni was not just a farmer but an alchemist of flavors, blending the fruits of his labor into exquisite oils and wines. His wife, Maria, was the soul of the kitchen.
